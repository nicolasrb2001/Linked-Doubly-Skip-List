# Linked-Doubly-Skip-List
This is my implementation of Singly, Doubly and Skip Linked Lists

## Motivation :earth_africa:
---
This was part of my coursework during 2nd year, the original task was implementing Singly and Doubly Linked List and the additional challenge was coding Skip Lists.

### Features
- All three types of lists support addition and removal of items.
### Technical Information
This was developed using [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). The source folder [src](/src) contains 3 test classes for Single and Doubly Linked list and the Skip List has a main method for testing purposes.
### Screenshots
These are for the Skip List as the other 2 are simpler.

This is an image of a test list used. There are 4 lanes, 3,2,1,0

GetHeads and GetNexts show the nยบ of operations performed for searching each item, which shows the correct functionality of this Skip List.
